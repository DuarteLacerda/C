# C Projects

This repository contains various small projects and exercises written in the C programming language.  
It's meant to serve as a collection of my learning, experimentation, and practice with C.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Contents

Each project folder typically includes:
- `main.c`: The main source file
- `Makefile`: To simplify compilation
- `README.md`: A short description of the specific project (if applicable)

## üì¶ Installation

To compile and run the projects, you need a C compiler such as:

- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

To compile using the terminal:

```bash
cd <folder_name>
make
./program
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

All projects in this repository were developed and tested on a **Linux environment**.  
Compilation and execution were done using tools available on Linux systems (e.g., GCC).  
If you're using Windows or macOS, some adjustments may be necessary.
