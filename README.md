# C Projects

This repository contains various small projects and exercises written in the C programming language.  
It's meant to serve as a collection of my personal learning, experimentation, and practice with C.

## Contents

Projects and exercises may include topics such as:
- Basic input/output
- Conditionals and loops
- Arrays and strings
- Pointers and memory management
- Structures
- File handling
- Algorithms and data structures

Each folder typically contains:
- `main.c`: The main source file
- Optional additional `.c` or `.h` files
- `README.md`: A short description of the project (if applicable)

## Requirements

To compile and run the projects, you need a C compiler such as:

- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

Example compilation command:

```bash
cd <folder_name>
make
./program
